# Make For Linux (Demo Version)
This is a demo implementation of a linux application which fetches a User configuration associated with specified programming language in a map file and executes it as a command, this is useful in case working on large projects so it becomes easier to build the entire project with just two words from the command line. 
make supports C, C++, xc8 compiler from microchip, rust, zig and java.
